The following project studies the matter of creating a management system for a sailclub, with an integrated sailing school.
The project first takes a wider look at the similarities of a sailclub, and other clubs used for freetime.
An analysis is made of sailclubs and their needs in a management system, and from this analysis an application is designes and developed. 
The design part of the project adresses the problem of having persistant data, from run-time to run-time. 
The project in the end concludes that is possible to create a management system, which will be able to have all the functionalities required by the sailclub. 
Although this is true, more work needs to be done on the application created alongside the project, in order for the projectgroup, to stand by the application as a good solution to the problem.
